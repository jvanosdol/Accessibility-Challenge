# <Accessibility-Challenge>

## Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge relating to proper CSS semantic structure and code consolidation. This project also demonstrates proper HTML and CSS accessibility.

This project solves the issues with the starter code we were given. The code, mostly the CSS, had to be consolidated, large portions of the CSS code were redundant. CSS code was consolidated and the HTML was then corrected to reflect the changes in the CSS.

## Technologies Used

In this project we used HTML, CSS, VSCode, and Github.

## Usage

This is found in a public github repository, you may clone this repository in order to build onto it.
