# <Accessibility-Challenge>

## Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge relating to proper CSS semantic structure and code consolidation. This project also demonstrates proper HTML and CSS accessibility.

This project solves the issues with the starter code we were given. The code, mostly the CSS, had to be consolidated, large portions of the CSS code were redundant. CSS code was consolidated and the HTML was then corrected to reflect the changes in the CSS.

## Usage

Files: 

index.html
style.css

There are only two files in this project, index.html provides a basic structure for the website, style.css provides the styling.
